The design is relatively straightforward. We have an exported class called LOTRClient that defines all the methods that will encapsulate our API calls and requires an API key upon construction to enable us to make calls to unauthorized endpoints. The user can easily grab the class from the package and create a new instance of the class with an API key and can start using the different method calls of the class.
